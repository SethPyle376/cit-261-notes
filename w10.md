## Validating Forms

Helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set in the various form controls.

- Field is required
- Field needs to be in a certain format
- Field needs to be a valid email address
- Password needs to be stronger

HTML5 has some built in validation, other validation can be implemented in javascript.

Built in validation is accessible through required, min, max, type, and pattern.

## Example

```javascript
<form>
    <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or cherry? (required)</label>
    <input id="choose" name="i_like" required>
    <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Using fetch

Fetch is used to make async http calls to other servers.

```javascript
fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

fetch() provides all options available to an http call. (method, headers, body, etc...)

credentials can be included with credentials: 'include' options.

Response can be fetched using .then() on returned promise.
